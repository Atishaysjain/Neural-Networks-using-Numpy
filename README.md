# Neural-Networks-using-Numpy
Hey guys! So I have a made a jupyter notebook which creates and trains neural network from scratch only using Numpy and no other machine learning library.
We train this neural network over fashion mnist dataset. You can check it out on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist?select=fashion-mnist_train.csv .

This notebook also EXPLAINS all steps of creating and training the neural network in detail.

Though currently no optimization or regularization has been added but i plan to add that soon :D
